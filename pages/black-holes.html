                            that nothing, including light or other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape
                            its event horizon. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon and it has no
                            locally detectable features according to general relativity. Black holes act like ideal
                            black bodies, reflecting no light and emitting Hawking radiation with a temperature
                            inversely proportional to their mass. They were first considered in the 18th century by John
                            Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace and the first modern solution of general relativity was
                            found in 1916 by Karl Schwarzschild. In the 1960s, theoretical work showed they were a
                            generic prediction of general relativity.

                            stars collapse. They can grow by absorbing mass from their surroundings or by merging with
                            other black holes. The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with
                            other matter and electromagnetic radiation such as visible light. Astronomers have
                            identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary systems and established that
                            Sagittarius A*, at the core of the Milky Way galaxy, contains a supermassive black hole of
                            about 4.3 million solar masses.

                            'dark star' in 1784, which would form when a star's diameter exceeds the Sun's and its
                            surface escape velocity exceeds the usual speed of light. However, modern physics discredits
                            Michell's notion of a light ray shooting directly from a supermassive star being slowed down
                            by gravity and then free-falling back to the star's surface.

                            1915. Karl Schwarzschild found a solution to the Einstein field equations that describes the
                            gravitational field of a point mass and a spherical mass. Johannes Droste independently gave
                            the same solution for the point mass. At the Schwarzschild radius, the solution became
                            singular, meaning some of the terms became infinite. Arthur Eddington showed that the
                            singularity disappeared after a change of coordinates, but Georges Lemaître realized that
                            this meant the singularity was a non-physical coordinate singularity.

                            electron-degenerate matter above a certain limiting mass has no stable solutions. Robert
                            Oppenheimer and others predicted that neutron stars above another limit (the
                            Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit) would collapse further for the reasons presented by
                            Chandrasekhar. Observations of the neutron star merger GW170817 have refined the TOV limit
                            estimate to 2.17 M. Oppenheimer and his co-authors interpreted the singularity at the
                            boundary of the Schwarzschild radius as indicating that this was the boundary of a bubble in
                            which time stopped.

                        <font style="font-size: 13pt">A black hole is a small celestial body that has only three
                            independent physical properties: mass, electric charge, and angular momentum. When an object
                            falls into a black hole, any information about the shape of the object or distribution of
                            charge on it is evenly distributed along the horizon of the black hole, and is lost to
                            outside observers. This behavior is similar to that of a conductive stretchy membrane with
                            friction and electrical resistance, unlike other field theories such as electromagnetism.
                            The information that is lost includes every quantity that cannot be measured far away from
                            the black hole horizon, including approximately conserved quantum numbers. This behavior is
                            known as the black hole information loss paradox.

                            only vacuum solution that is spherically symmetric. The Kerr-Newman metric describes a black
                            hole with both charge and angular momentum, and the total electric charge and angular
                            momentum are expected to satisfy the inequality.

                            community, but a minority of relativists persuaded researchers in the field that black holes
                            were physical objects. Simulations of two black holes colliding Penrose demonstrated that an
                            event horizon requires a singularity to form, and Hawking showed that many cosmological
                            solutions have singularities without exotic matter.
