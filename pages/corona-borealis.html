                            Hemisphere and is one of the 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy. Its Latin name, inspired
                            by its shape, means "northern crown". In classical mythology, it represented the crown given
                            by the god Dionysus to the Cretan princess Ariadne and set by her in the heavens. The
                            brightest star is the magnitude 2.2 Alpha Coronae Borealis. R Coronae Borealis is the
                            prototype of a rare class of giant stars—the R Coronae Borealis variables—which are
                            extremely hydrogen deficient.

                            than 400 members, and is itself part of the larger Corona Borealis Supercluster.

                            Alpha Coronae Borealis, which is the brightest of them. Johann Bayer gave twenty stars in
                            Corona Borealis Bayer designations from Alpha to Upsilon in his 1603 star atlas Uranometria.
                            Zeta Coronae Borealis was noted to be a double star by later astronomers and its components
                            named Zeta1 and Zeta2. John Flamsteed classed Nu Coronae Borealis as a single star and named
                            it 20 and 21 Coronae Borealis in his catalogue. Chinese astronomers deemed nine stars to
                            make up the asterism, adding Pi and Rho Coronae Borealis.

                            of Theseus and the minotaur. It was generally considered to represent a crown given by
                            Dionysus to Ariadne, the daughter of Minos of Crete, after she had been abandoned by the
                            Athenian prince Theseus. In Welsh mythology, it was called Caer Arianrhod, "the Castle of
                            the Silver Circle", and was the heavenly abode of the Lady Arianrhod. To the ancient Balts,
                            it was known as Darelis, the "flower garden". The Arabs called it Alphecca, which means
                            "separated" or "broken up".
