                            it is massive enough to have about the same surface gravity as the even larger planet Mars.

                            planet went through a magma ocean phase early in its history. Crystallization of minerals
                            and convective overturn resulted in layered, chemically heterogeneous crust with large-scale

                            planets. The surface is dominated by iron-poor pyroxene and olivine, as represented by
                            enstatite and forsterite, respectively, along with sodium-rich plagioclase and minerals of
                            mixed magnesium, calcium, and iron-sulfide. The less reflective regions of the crust are
                            high in carbon, most likely in the form of graphite.

                            orbit (the ecliptic), the largest of all eight known solar planets.As a result, transits of
                            Mercury across the face of the Sun can only occur when the planet is crossing the plane of
                            the ecliptic at the time it lies between Earth and the Sun, which is in May or November.
                            This occurs about every seven years on average.

                            At certain points on Mercury's surface, an observer would be able to see the Sun peek up a
                            little more than two-thirds of the way over the horizon, then reverse and set before rising
                            again, all within the same Mercurian day.This is because approximately four Earth days
                            before perihelion, Mercury's angular orbital velocity equals its angular rotational velocity
                            so that the Sun's apparent motion ceases.

                            In medieval Islamic astronomy, the Andalusian astronomer Abū Ishāq Ibrāhīm al-Zarqālī in the
                            11th century described the deferent of Mercury's geocentric orbit as being oval, like an egg
                            or a pignon, although this insight did not influence his astronomical theory or his
                            astronomical calculations. In the 12th century, Ibn Bajjah observed "two planets as black
                            spots on the face of the Sun", which was later suggested as the transit of Mercury and/or
                            Venus by the Maragha astronomer Qotb al-Din Shirazi in the 13th century.

                            system of metaphysics. Modern Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese cultures refer to the
                            planet literally as the "water star" (水星), based on the Five elements.Hindu mythology used
                            the name Budha for Mercury, and this god was thought to preside over Wednesday.
