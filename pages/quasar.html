                        <font style="font-size: 13pt">A quasar is an active galactic nucleus (AGN) that is sometimes
                            known as a quasi-stellar object, abbreviated QSO. It is powered by a supermassive black hole
                            with a mass ranging from millions to tens of billions of solar masses, surrounded by a
                            gaseous accretion disc. The redshifts of quasars are of cosmological origin and the term
                            originated from "quasi-stellar [star-like] radio source". The observed properties of a
                            quasar depend on many factors, including the mass of the black hole, the rate of gas
                            accretion, the orientation of the accretion disc relative to the observer, the presence or
                            absence of a jet, and the degree of obscuration by gas and dust within the host galaxy.

                        <font style="font-size: 13pt">Between 1917 and 1922, it became clear that some objects seen by
                            astronomers were distant galaxies like the Milky Way. When radio astronomy began in the
                            1950s, astronomers detected a small number of anomalous objects with properties that defied
                            explanation. These objects emitted large amounts of radiation of many frequencies, but no
                            source could be located optically.

                        <font style="font-size: 13pt">The spectral lines of these objects were also extremely strange
                            and defied explanation. Some of them changed their luminosity very rapidly in the optical
                            range and even more rapidly in the X-ray range, suggesting an upper limit on their size,
                            perhaps no larger than the Solar System. Considerable discussion took place over what these
                            objects might be, and they were described as "quasi-stellar radio sources", or
                            "quasi-stellar objects" (QSOs) a name which reflected their unknown nature, and this became
                            shortened to "quasar".

                            of 2021). They are between 600 million and 29.36 billion light-years away in terms of
                            comoving distance. The power of quasars originates from supermassive black holes that are
                            believed to exist at the core of most galaxies. Quasars are visible from extreme distances,
                            being the most luminous objects in the known universe. The brightest quasar in the sky is 3C
                            273 in the constellation of Virgo.

                            magnitude of 26.7. From a distance of about 33 light-years, this object would shine in the
                            sky about as brightly as the Sun. Quasars are quasars that have a luminosity of about 4
                            trillion (41012) times that of the Sun, or about 100 times that of the total light of giant
                            galaxies like the Milky Way. They are assumed to be radiating energy in all directions, but
                            the active galactic nucleus is believed to be radiating preferentially in the direction of
                            its jet. Quasars were much more common in the early universe than they are today, and
                            Maarten Schmidt's discovery in 1967 was early strong evidence against steady-state cosmology
                            and in favor of the Big Bang cosmology.

                            growing rapidly (by accretion). Detailed simulations reported in 2021 showed that galaxy
                            structures, such as spiral arms, use gravitational forces to 'put the brakes on' gas that
                            would otherwise orbit galaxy centers forever, allowing the gas to fall into the supermassive
                            black holes, releasing enormous radiant energies. These black holes co-evolve with the mass
                            of stars in their host galaxy in a way not fully understood at present. The jets that
                            produce strong radio emission in some quasars at the centers of clusters of galaxies are
                            known to have enough power to prevent the hot gas in those clusters from cooling and falling
                            on to the central galaxy.</font>
