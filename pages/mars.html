                            massive terrestrial object in the Solar System. Mars has a thin atmosphere and a crust
                            primarily composed of elements similar to Earth's crust, as well as a core made of iron and
                            nickel. Mars has surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice
                            caps. Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos. </span></font>

                            Mons, the largest volcano and highest-known mountain in the Solar System, and Valles
                            Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The Borealis basin in the
                            Northern Hemisphere covers approximately 40% of the planet and may be a large impact
                            feature. Days and seasons on Mars are comparable to those of Earth, as the planets have a
                            similar rotation period and tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane.

                            Mars's polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water. In the distant past, Mars was
                            likely wetter, and thus possibly more suited for life. It is not known whether life has ever
                            existed on Mars.</span></font>

                            Mars was created as the result of a random process of run-away accretion of material from
                            the protoplanetary disk that orbited the Sun. Mars has many distinctive chemical features
                            caused by its position in the Solar System.</span></font>

                            Bombardment". About 60% of the surface of Mars shows a record of impacts from that era,
                            whereas much of the remaining surface is probably underlain by immense impact basins caused
                            by those events. There is evidence of an enormous impact basin in the Northern Hemisphere of
                            Mars, spanning 10,600 by 8,500 kilometres (6,600 by 5,300 mi), or roughly four times the
                            size of the Moon's South Pole – Aitken basin, the largest impact basin yet discovered.

                            strikes,so the solar wind interacts directly with the Martian ionosphere, lowering the
                            atmospheric density by stripping away atoms from the outer layer. Compared to Earth,
                            the atmosphere of Mars is quite rarefied.

                            dusty, containing particulates about 1.5 µm in diameter which give the Martian sky a tawny
                            color when seen from the surface.It may take on a pink hue due to iron oxide particles

                            Mars is named after the Roman god of war. This association between Mars and war dates back
                            at least to Babylonian astronomy, in which the planet was named for the god Nergal, deity of
                            war and destruction. It persisted into modern times, as exemplified by Gustav Holst's
                            orchestral suite The Planets, whose famous first movement labels Mars "the bringer of war".
                            The planet's symbol, a circle with a spear pointing out to the upper right, is also used as
                            a symbol for the male gender.The symbol dates from at latest the 11th century, though a
                            possible predecessor has been found in the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri.

                        <font style="font-size: 13pt">The depiction of Mars in fiction has been stimulated by its
                            dramatic red color and by nineteenth-century scientific speculations that its surface
                            conditions might support not just life but intelligent life. This gave way to many science
                            fiction stories involving these concepts, such as H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, in
                            which Martians seek to escape their dying planet by invading Earth, Ray Bradbury's The
                            Martian Chronicles, in which human explorers accidentally destroy a Martian civilization, as
                            well as Edgar Rice Burroughs' Barsoom series, C. S. Lewis' novel Out of the Silent Planet
                            (1938).

                            Martian, Marvin the Martian, appeared in Haredevil Hare (1948) as a character in the Looney
                            Tunes animated cartoons of Warner Brothers, and has continued as part of popular culture to
                            the present.
