                        <font style="font-size: 13pt">Omega Centauri is a globular cluster in the constellation of Centaurus, estimated to contain 10 million stars and a total mass equivalent to 4 million solar masses. It is the largest-known globular cluster in the Milky Way at a diameter of roughly 150 light-years. It is believed to have originated as the core remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy, making it the most massive-known globular cluster in the Milky Way.

                        <font style="font-size: 13pt">It has been speculated that Omega Centauri is the core of a dwarf galaxy that was disrupted and absorbed by the Milky Way. Indeed, Kapteyn's Star, which is currently only 13 light-years away from Earth, is thought to originate from Omega Centauri. Omega Centauri's chemistry and motion in the Milky Way are also consistent with this picture. Like Mayall II, Omega Centauri has a range of metallicities and stellar ages that suggests that it did not all form at once (as globular clusters are thought to form) and may in fact be the remainder of the core of a smaller galaxy long since incorporated into the Milky Way.

It is the brightest, largest and most massive-known globular cluster associated with the Milky Way. It contains several million Population II stars and is about 12 billion years old. The stars in the core of the cluster are estimated to average only 0.1 light-year away from each other. The internal dynamics of the cluster have been analyzed using measurements of the radial velocities of 469 stars.

                        <font style="font-size: 13pt">Omega Centauri is a cluster of stars located in the northern part of the Milky Way. In 2008, a study presented evidence for an intermediate-mass black hole at the center of the cluster, based on observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope and Gemini Observatory. E. Noyola and colleagues found that stars closer to the core are moving faster than stars farther away, indicating that unseen matter at the core is interacting gravitationally with nearby stars. They calculated the object's mass at 40,000 solar masses. However, recent work has challenged conclusions that there is a black hole in the cluster's core, in particular disputing the proposed location of the cluster center.

                        <font style="font-size: 13pt">Calculations using a revised location for the center found that the velocity of core stars does not vary with distance, as would be expected if an intermediate-mass black hole were present. The authors noted that their results do not entirely rule out the black hole proposed by Noyola and colleagues, and limit its maximum mass to 12,000 solar masses.</span></font>
